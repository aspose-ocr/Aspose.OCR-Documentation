Aspose.OCR for Java can recognize a text in a large number of languages and all popular writing scripts, including texts with mixed languages.

To specify a language for recognition, provide one of the following values in [`setLanguage`](https://reference.aspose.com/ocr/java/com.aspose.ocr/RecognitionSettings#setLanguage-com.Language-) method of [RecognitionSettings](https://reference.aspose.com/ocr/java/com.aspose.ocr/RecognitionSettings) class:

Value | Language
----- | --------
`Language.None` | [Extended Latin](/ocr/java/recognition-languages/#supported-characters) characters, including diacritics
`Language.Latin` | [Extended Latin](/ocr/java/recognition-languages/#supported-characters) characters, including diacritics
`Language.Cyrillic` | [Cyrillic](/ocr/java/recognition-languages/#supported-characters-1) characters
`Language.Bel` | Belorussian
`Language.Bul` | Bulgarian
`Language.Chi` | Chinese (more than 6,000 characters)
`Language.Cze` | Czech
`Language.Dan` | Danish
`Language.Deu` | German
`Language.Dum` | Dutch
`Language.Eng` | English
`Language.Est` | Estonian
`Language.Fin` | Finnish
`Language.Fra` | French
`Language.Hin` | Hindi
`Language.Ita` | Italian
`Language.Kaz` | Kazakh
`Language.Lav` | Latvian
`Language.Lit` | Lithuanian
`Language.Nor` | Norwegian
`Language.Pol` | Polish
`Language.Por` | Portuguese
`Language.Rum` | Romanian
`Language.Rus` | Russian
`Language.Slk` | Slovak
`Language.Slv` | Slovene
`Language.Spa` | Spanish
`Language.Srp` | Serbian
`Language.Srp_hrv` | Serbo-Croatian
`Language.Swe` | Swedish
`Language.Ukr` | Ukrainian

If this parameter is omitted, the OCR engine will assume that the text is written in extended Latin.

Make sure you specify the correct language for the image. If you try to recognize Cyrillic text using `Language.Eng`, only the characters that look the same in both languages (for example, `—Å` and `c`) will be correctly recognized. Other characters will be replaced with similar-looking alternatives.

## Example

The following code sample demonstrates how to specify the recognition language:

```java
AsposeOCR api = new AsposeOCR();
RecognitionSettings recognitionSettings = new RecognitionSettings();
// Recognize Ukrainian text
recognitionSettings.setLanguage(Language.Ukr);
RecognitionResult result = api.RecognizePage("source.png", recognitionSettings);
System.out.println("Recognition result:\n" + result.recognitionText + "\n\n");
```
