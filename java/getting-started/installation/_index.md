## **Installing Aspose.OCR for Java from Maven Repository**

Aspose hosts all Java APIs on theÂ [Maven repository](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose). You can easily use [Aspose.OCR for Java](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-ocr) API directly in your Maven Projects with simple configurations.

### **Installing Aspose.OCR for Java from Maven Repository**
 
First, [download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and follow the [installation instructions](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

Then run command to create project

`mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart `
`-DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false`

Notice: If you want to use **GPU version** you have to make sure does your GPU supports **CUDA** and install CUDA 10.1
Installation guide for CUDA you can find by link [CUDA install](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html)

### **Specify Maven Repository Configuration**

First, you need to specify Aspose Maven Repository configuration/location in your Maven pom.xml as follows:

Copy 

```java
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>AsposeJavaAPI</id>
        <name>Aspose Java API</name>
        <url>http://repository.aspose.com/repo/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Define Aspose.OCR for Java API Dependency
Then define Aspose.OCR for Java API dependency in your **pom.xml** as follows:

Copy 

```java
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
        <artifactId>aspose-ocr</artifactId>
        <version>22.5</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
or 

```java
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
        <artifactId>aspose-ocr-gpu</artifactId>
        <version>20.11</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

After performing the above steps, Aspose.OCR for Java dependency will finally be defined in your Maven Project.


## **Installing Aspose.OCR for Java from local package**

 - download jar files from https://downloads.aspose.com/ocr/java

 - create aspose-ocr-[version].pom file with next content (aspose-ocr--gpu-[version].pom)
