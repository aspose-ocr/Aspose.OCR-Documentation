You can easily download an evaluation version of Aspose.OCR for Java from the [download page](https://repository.aspose.com/repo/com/aspose/aspose-ocr/). The evaluation version provides the same capabilities as the licensed version of the component. Furthermore, evaluation version simply becomes licensed when you purchase a license and add a couple of lines of code to apply the license.

The evaluation version of Aspose.OCR (that is, the component running without a license applied) limits the number of characters extracted from an image to 50.

If you want to try Aspose.OCR without evaluation version limitations, you can also request a 30-day temporary license. Please refer to [How to get a Temporary License?](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license) for more information.
