Optical character recognition (OCR) technology simplifies and accelerates business operations by automating the conversion of images into machine-readable text, saving time, finances, and resources. Through the utilization of advanced machine learning and neural networks, this technology efficiently extracts text from scans, photos, or other images, eliminating the necessity for manual retyping.

Aspose.OCR for Python via C++ brings OCR to any Python script, service or analytical notebook, both on-premises and in the cloud. With just a few lines of cross-platform code, you can convert images to text without having to worry about complicated technical details.
