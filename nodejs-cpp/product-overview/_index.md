Optical character recognition (OCR) technology streamlines business processes, saves time, finances, and resources by automatically converting images to machine-readable text. Employing sophisticated machine learning and neural networks, it extracts text from scans, photos, or other images, eliminating the need for manual retyping.

Aspose.OCR for Node.js via C++ brings OCR to any Node.js application or service, both on-premises and in the cloud. With just a few lines of code, you can convert images to text without having to worry about complicated technical details.
