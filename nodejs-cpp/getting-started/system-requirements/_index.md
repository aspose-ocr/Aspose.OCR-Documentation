Aspose.OCR for Node.js via C++ can run on any system with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **14.x** or above. It is also applicable in cloud environments, including serverless options such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions.

As of Node.js version 15 and later, the `--no-experimental-fetch` flag is required for using Aspose.OCR for Node.js via C++ API:

```bash
$ node --no-experimental-fetch aspose_ocr_example.js
```

In addition to Node.js, the library requires [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) version **11** or later. This component is already included in the [downloadable package](https://releases.aspose.com/ocr/nodejs-cpp/).
