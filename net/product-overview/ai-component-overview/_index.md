Aspose.OCR for .NET introduces a new **AI Component** that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into the OCR pipeline.

This feature enables enhanced text recognition by performing **automatic spell-check correction** and **post-recognition text enhancement**, especially useful in poor scan quality, handwritten text, or low-resolution documents.

## What does it do?

The AI component can:

- Improve recognition accuracy via **intelligent spell-check**.
- Support models hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co).

> ⚠️ Now, the AI component focuses on spell-check correction. Future versions will expand to:
> - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
> - Conversational search within recognized content (chat-like interaction with documents)
> - Automatic detection of personal and sensitive data across documents
> - Smart document summarization — generate concise summaries of lengthy content
> - Text structure reconstruction from images with complex or irregular layouts
> - Structured data extraction from semi-structured documents (e.g., invoices, medical records, forms, and tables)


## Where it's used

- Available via the `AsposeAI` class.
