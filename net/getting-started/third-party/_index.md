Aspose.OCR for .NET relies on the following third-party components:

- [Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime/) version **1.18.0** (for **Aspose.OCR** package only).
- [Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Gpu](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Gpu/) version **1.7.1** (for **Aspose.OCR-GPU** only).
- [Aspose.Drawing](https://products.aspose.com/drawing/net/) version **24.7**.
- [Aspose.PDF](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/net/) version **24.2**.

These packages are automatically installed when you [install](/ocr/net/installation/) Aspose.OCR / Aspose.OCR-GPU for .NET NuGet package. You will only need to add these packages if you install Aspose.OCR for .NET using the MSI installer or by manually adding _Aspose.Ocr.dll_ library to the project.

The Aspose.OCR for .NET library is optimized and tested for the listed third-party component versions. Using other versions, including latest releases, can potentially introduce compatibility issues and unexpected errors.
