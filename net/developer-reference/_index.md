This reference will guide you through everything you need to know to get the most out of Aspose.OCR for .NET.

Aspose.OCR for .NET handles all aspects of recognition - from preprocessing the image to saving recognition results. A full-cycle OCR process involves 5 main stages:

![Stages of Aspose.OCR image processing](ocr-stages.png)

1. **Preparing content for recognition**:

    - [Prepare a batch of images, scanned PDFs, URLs and other content for recognition](/ocr/net/ocrinput/)
    - [Apply image processing filters](/ocr/net/image-processing/)

2. **Configuring recognition parameters**:

    - [Specify a recognition language](/ocr/net/languages/)
    - [Limit the subset of characters the OCR module will look for](/ocr/net/characters/)
    - [Customize recognition parameters](/ocr/net/settings/)
    - [Select document areas detection algorithm](/ocr/net/areas-detection/)

3. **Recognizing**:

    - [Extract text](/ocr/net/recognition/)
    - [Recognize unified document types](/ocr/net/specialized-recognition-methods/)
    - [Balance recognition speed, quality, and resource usage](/ocr/net/performance-optimization/)

4. **Post-processing**:

    - [Detect and manipulate image regions](/ocr/net/image-regions/)
    - [Automatically correct misspelled words](/ocr/net/spelling/)

5. **Fetching recognition results**:

    - [Save recognition results as a file](/ocr/net/save-file/)
    - [Save recognition results as a searchable PDF](/ocr/net/save-searchable-pdf/)
    - [Get recognition results as text](/ocr/net/save-text/)
    - [Get recognition results as JSON](/ocr/net/save-json/)
    - [Get recognition results as XML](/ocr/net/save-xml/)
