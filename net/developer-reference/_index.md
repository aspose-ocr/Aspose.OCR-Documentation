This reference will guide you through everything you need to know to get the most out of Aspose.OCR for .NET.

Aspose.OCR for .NET handles all aspects of recognition - from preprocessing the image to saving recognition results. A full-cycle OCR process involves 5 main stages:

![Stages of Aspose.OCR image processing](ocr-stages.png)

1. [**Pre-processing**](/ocr/net/image-preprocessing/): enhance an image before it is sent to the OCR engine to enhance recognition accuracy.
2. **Configuring recognition parameters**:

    - [Specify a language for recognition](/ocr/net/languages/)
    - [Limit the subset of characters the OCR module will look for](/ocr/net/characters/)
    - [Customize recognition parameters](/ocr/net/settings/)
    - [Select document areas detection algorithm](/ocr/net/areas-detection/)

3. **Recognizing**:

    - [Extracting text from an image, document, or other media](/ocr/net/recognition/)
    - [Balancing recognition speed, quality, and resource usage](/ocr/net/performance-optimization/)

4. **Post-processing**:

    - [Working with image regions](/ocr/net/image-regions/)
    - [Automatic spelling corrections](/ocr/net/spelling/)

5. [**Saving recognition results**](/ocr/net/save/)
