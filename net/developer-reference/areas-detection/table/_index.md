When this mode is enabled, OCR engine detects tabular structures on an image and extracts text from cells. This areas detection mode is recommended when working with scanned spreadsheets, financial and accounting reports, invoices, and other tables.

However, this algorithm is inefficient when dealing with large amounts of text, such as pages from books and newspaper articles. Try [**DetectAreasMode.DOCUMENT**](/ocr/net/areas-detection/document/) instead.

## Example

The following code sample demonstrates how to use this document areas detection algorithm:

```csharp
Aspose.OCR.AsposeOcr recognitionEngine = new Aspose.OCR.AsposeOcr();
Aspose.OCR.RecognitionSettings recognitionSettings = new Aspose.OCR.RecognitionSettings();
recognitionSettings.DetectAreasMode = Aspose.OCR.DetectAreasMode.TABLE;
// Recognize image
Aspose.OCR.RecognitionResult result = recognitionEngine.RecognizeImage("source.png", recognitionSettings);
Console.WriteLine(result.RecognitionText);
```
