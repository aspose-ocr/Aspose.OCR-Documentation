This algorithm works best with large amounts of structured text such as scanned contracts, book pages, articles, newspapers, and the like. It breaks content into larger blocks, such as paragraphs and columns. These blocks are then analyzed, read and combined into recognition results.

However, it may not be suitable for analyzing photographs and small amounts of irregular text - try [**DetectAreasMode.PHOTO**](/ocr/areas-detection/photo/) instead.

## Example

The following code sample demonstrates how to use this document areas detection algorithm:

```csharp
Aspose.OCR.AsposeOcr recognitionEngine = new Aspose.OCR.AsposeOcr();
Aspose.OCR.RecognitionSettings recognitionSettings = new Aspose.OCR.RecognitionSettings();
recognitionSettings.DetectAreasMode = Aspose.OCR.DetectAreasMode.DOCUMENT;
// Recognize image
Aspose.OCR.RecognitionResult result = recognitionEngine.RecognizeImage("source.png", recognitionSettings);
Console.WriteLine(result.RecognitionText);
```
