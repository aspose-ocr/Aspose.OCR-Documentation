Aspose.OCR for .NET allows for very flexible balancing of recognition speed, quality, and resource usage for each use case:

- [Fast recognition](/ocr/net/fast-recognition/) for simple and clear images, such as high-quality scans. About twice as fast as regular recognition.
- Extracting text from images which contain a [single line of text](/ocr/net/recognize-single-line/). About 7 times faster than normal OCR.
- [Limiting the number of threads](/ocr/net/multithreading/) used by the recognition engine.
- Fine-tuning [image preprocessing filters](/ocr/net/image-preprocessing/).
- [Customizing](/ocr/net/recognition-settings/) recognition accuracy, performance, and other settings.
