## Select Language for OCR Operation

Aspose.OCR for .NET provides the option to specify the language to increase the efficiency of the OCR operation. For this, the API provides the [**RecognitionSettings.Language**](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/net/aspose.ocr/recognitionsettings/properties/language) property. The [**RecognitionSettings.Language**](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/net/aspose.ocr/recognitionsettings/properties/language) property accepts the [**Language**](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/net/aspose.ocr/language) enumeration as value. You can pass the instance of the [**RecognitionSettings**](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/net/aspose.ocr/recognitionsettings) class to the [**RecognizeImage**](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/net/aspose.ocr/asposeocr/methods/recognizeimage/index) method of the [**AsposeOcr**](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/net/aspose.ocr/asposeocr) class. The [**Language**](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/net/aspose.ocr/language) enum has the following members.

|Member|Language|
| :- | :- |
|**None**|Multi-language support|
|**En**|English (en)|
|**De**|German (de)|
|**Pt**|Portuguese (pt)|
|**Es**|Spanish (es)|
|**Fr**|French (fr)|
