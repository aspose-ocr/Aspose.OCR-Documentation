## **Provide allowed characters during OCR operation**
In case you know the characters that are present in the image, you can pass those characters while instantiating the [AsposeOCR](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/net/aspose.ocr/asposeocr) class. Doing this will ensure that only the provided characters are matched in the OCR process. The following code snippet demonstrates setting the allowed characters for the OCR process.
