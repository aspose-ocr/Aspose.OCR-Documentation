## Welcome to Aspose.OCR for .NET

![Aspose.OCR for .NET](aspose-ocr-net.png)

**Aspose.OCR for .NET** is a powerful yet easy-to-use and cost-effective API for converting images to text. It allows you to add optical character recognition (OCR) functionality to your .NET desktop or web application in less than 10 lines of code without worrying about complex formulas, neural networks and other technical details.

Years of development resulted in a state-of-art optical character recognition engine with superior speed and accuracy that supports 26 [languages](/ocr/net/recognition-languages/) based on Latin and Cyrillic scrips as well as Chinese.

Aspose.OCR can recognize scanned images or even smartphone photos in the most popular [formats](/ocr/net/supported-file-formats/): PDF, JPG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, GIF, or DjVu. Various pre-processing filters allow you to recognize rotated, skewed and noisy images. Recognition results are returned in the most popular document and data exchange formats: plain text, PDF, Word, Excel, JSON, XML; and can be further analyzed and spell-checked.

Aspose.OCR for .NET is implemented using Managed C# and can be used with any [.NET framework](/ocr/net/system-requirements/#supported-frameworks). The library comes with a number of examples written in C# that allow you to quickly familiarize yourself with its functions and capabilities and give you an idea of creating solutions for your business needs.
