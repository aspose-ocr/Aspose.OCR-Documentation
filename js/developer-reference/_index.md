This reference will guide you through everything you need to know to get the most out of Aspose.OCR for JavaScript via C++.

Aspose.OCR for JavaScript via C++ handles all aspects of recognition - from preparing the content for recognition to returning recognition results. A full-cycle OCR process involves 4 main stages:

1. **Preparing content for recognition**:

    - [Provide a collection of pages, photos, and other content](/ocr/javascript-cpp/content-for-ocr/)

2. **Configuring recognition parameters**:

    - [Specify a language for recognition](/ocr/javascript-cpp/languages/)
    - [Limit the subset of characters the OCR module will look for](/ocr/javascript-cpp/characters/)
    - [Customize recognition parameters](/ocr/javascript-cpp/settings/)
    - [Select document areas detection algorithm](/ocr/javascript-cpp/areas-detection/)

3. **Recognizing**:

    - [Extract text from an image, document, or other media](/ocr/javascript-cpp/recognition/)

4. **Fetching recognition results**:

    - [Get recognition results as text](/ocr/javascript-cpp/save-text/)
    - [Get recognition results as JSON](/ocr/javascript-cpp/save-json/)
    - [Get recognition results as XML](/ocr/javascript-cpp/save-xml/)
