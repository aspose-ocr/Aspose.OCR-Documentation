## Aspose.OCR for JavaScript via C++

![Aspose.OCR for JavaScript via C++](aspose-ocr-javascript-cpp.png)

**Aspose.OCR for JavaScript via C++** lets you extract text from scanned images, screenshots, pictures from the web, or even smartphone photos without leaving your web browser.

Its powerful and feature rich yet easy to use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) API is based on WebAssembly (Wasm) technology. As such, it can be natively integrated into your JavaScript context, including access to web browser functions. Aspose.OCR for JavaScript via C++ provides the highest security when embedded on the web, and will enforce the browser's same-origin and permissions security policies.

Our OCR module supports 28 languages based on Latin, Cyrillic and Asian scripts, including more than 6000 Chinese characters, and can recognize files in the most popular formats: PDF, JPG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, GIF or DjVu. Various processing filters allow you to recognize rotated, skewed and noisy images. The recognition results are returned in the most popular document and data exchange formats. Automatic spelling correction will further improve the accuracy without manual intervention.
