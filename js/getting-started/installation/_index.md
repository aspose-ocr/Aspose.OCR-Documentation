**Aspose.OCR for JavaScript via C++** is distributed as a [downloadable package](https://releases.aspose.com/ocr/javascript-cpp/).

To use it, simply unpack the downloaded archive somewhere on your web site or next to the HTML page and reference `./lib/asposeocr.js` file in the code:

```html
<script src="lib/asposeocr.js"></script>
```

To update the library, simply replace the contents of the package by unpacking the new archive to the same location as the previous version overwriting the existing files.
