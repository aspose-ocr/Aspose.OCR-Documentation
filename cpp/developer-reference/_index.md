This reference will guide you through everything you need to know to get the most out of Aspose.OCR for C++.

Aspose.OCR for C++ handles all aspects of recognition - from preprocessing the image to saving recognition results. A full-cycle OCR process involves 5 main stages:

![Stages of Aspose.OCR image processing](ocr-stages.png)

1. [**Pre-processing**](/ocr/cpp/image-preprocessing/): enhance an image before it is sent to the OCR engine to enhance recognition accuracy.
2. **Configuring recognition parameters**:

    - [Specify a language for recognition](/ocr/cpp/languages/)
    - [Limit the subset of characters the OCR module will look for](/ocr/cpp/characters/)
    - [Customize recognition parameters](/ocr/cpp/settings/)
    - [Select document areas detection algorithm](/ocr/cpp/areas-detection/)

3. **Recognizing**:

    - [Extracting text from an image, document, or other media](/ocr/cpp/recognition/)
    - [Balancing recognition speed, quality, and resource usage](/ocr/cpp/performance-optimization/)

4. **Post-processing**:

    - [Working with image regions](/ocr/cpp/image-regions/)

5. **Saving recognition results**:

    - [Saving recognition results as a file](/ocr/cpp/save-file/)
    - [Getting recognition results as text](/ocr/cpp/save-text/)
    - [Getting recognition results as JSON](/ocr/cpp/save-json/)
    - [Getting recognition results as XML](/ocr/cpp/save-xml/)
