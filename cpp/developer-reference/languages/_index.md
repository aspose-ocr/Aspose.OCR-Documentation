Aspose.OCR for C++ can recognize a text in a large number of languages and all popular writing scripts, including texts with mixed languages.

To specify a language for recognition, provide one of the following values in `language_alphabet` property in [recognition settings](https://reference.aspose.com/ocr/cpp/struct/recognition_settings):

Value | Language
----- | --------
`language::none` | [Extended Latin](/ocr/cpp/recognition-languages/#supported-characters) characters, including diacritics
`language::bel` | Belorussian
`language::bul` | Bulgarian
`language::chi` | Chinese (more than 6,000 characters)
`language::cze` | Czech
`language::dan` | Danish
`language::deu` | German
`language::dum` | Dutch
`language::eng` | English
`language::est` | Estonian
`language::fin` | Finnish
`language::fra` | French
`language::ita` | Italian
`language::kaz` | Kazakh
`language::lav` | Latvian
`language::lit` | Lithuanian
`language::nor` | Norwegian
`language::pol` | Polish
`language::por` | Portuguese
`language::rum` | Romanian
`language::rus` | Russian
`language::slk` | Slovak
`language::slv` | Slovene
`language::spa` | Spanish
`language::srp` | Serbian
`language::srp_hrv` | Serbo-Croatian
`language::swe` | Swedish
`language::ukr` | Ukrainian

If this parameter is omitted, the OCR engine will assume that the text is written in extended Latin.

Make sure you specify the correct language for the image. If you try to recognize Cyrillic text using `language::Eng`, only the characters that look the same in both languages (for example, `—Å` and `c`) will be correctly recognized. Other characters will be replaced with similar-looking alternatives.

## Example

The following code sample demonstrates how to specify the recognition language:

```cpp
std::string image_path = "source.png";
const size_t len = 4096;
wchar_t buffer[len] = { 0 };
RecognitionSettings settings;
settings.language_alphabet = language::ukr;
size_t res_len = aspose::ocr::page_settings(image_path.c_str(), buffer, len, settings);
std::wcout << buffer;
```
