## Welcome to Aspose.OCR for C++

![Aspose.OCR for C++](aspose-ocr-cpp.png)

**Aspose.OCR for C++** is a powerful cross-platform API for converting images to text. It allows you to add optical character recognition (OCR) functionality to your C and C++ applications in less than 10 lines of code without diving deep into machine learning, complex calculations, and other low-level technical details. Recognition speed, accuracy and performance can be further improved by distributing computation across multiple CPU cores and offloading resource-intensive tasks to the GPU.

Aspose experience with machine learning technologies and years of development resulted in an OCR engine with superior speed and accuracy that supports [28 languages](/ocr/cpp/recognition-languages/) based on Latin, Cyrillic and Asian scrips, including more than 6,000 Chinese characters and Hindi. Aspose.OCR for C++ can also read texts in mixed languages.

OCR API processes scanned images, smartphone photos, screenshots, areas of an image, and scanned PDFs and returns results in the most popular [document formats](/ocr/cpp/supported-file-formats/). Various preprocessing filters allow you to recognize rotated, skewed and noisy images.

The package comes with a number of examples that allow you to quickly familiarize yourself with its functions and capabilities and give you an idea of creating solutions for your business needs.
