Optical character recognition (OCR) technology is the key element of the digital transformation. It uses advanced artificial intelligence techniques to automatically recognize text in a photo or scanned image instead of manually retyping printed or handwritten documents.

Aspose.OCR for C++ can help you get the best results with the least cost and effort. With just a few lines of code, you can create full-featured on-premise and web-based applications that convert images to text without having to worry about complicated technical details.

Aspose.OCR can be combined with other Aspose products, such as [Aspose C++ PDF Parser API](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) and [Aspose C++ PowerPoint API](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) to create end-to-end optical recognition solutions.
