Our sample applications are the fastest and easiest way to get familiar with Aspose.OCR for C++ and to explore its features and capabilities.

## System requirements

Your system must meet the following requirements to run the examples:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 or later.
- [NuGet package manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools) with _nuget.org_ package source enabled.
- Active internet connection for obtaining Aspose.OCR package through NuGet Automatic Package Restore.  
  Alternatively, you can [download](https://downloads.aspose.com/ocr/cpp) Aspose.OCR for C++ package from our web site and [reference](/ocr/cpp/installation/#downloadable) it in the example project.

## Downloading the examples

All Aspose.OCR for C++ examples are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-ocr/Aspose.OCR-for-C). You can either clone the repository using your favorite GitHub client or [download](https://github.com/aspose-ocr/Aspose.OCR-for-C/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) it as a ZIP archive.

1. Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP archive to the local machine (if necessary).
2. _Data_ folder contains all the source files required to run examples.
3. Open _Aspose.OCR-for-C.vcxproj_ solution file from _Aspose.OCR-for-C_ folder with Microsoft Visual Studio.
4. Open `main.cpp` file from _Aspose.OCR-for-C_ folder and uncomment the examples you want to run in the `main` function.
5. Build the project. On the first run, all required dependencies will be automatically downloaded via NuGet.

Feel free to contact us through our [Free Support Forum] (https://forum.aspose.com/c/ocr/16) if you have any problems running the examples.
