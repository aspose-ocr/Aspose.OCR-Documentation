Virtually every business process today is paper-based: contracts, invoices, legal documents, reports, and more. Even basic digitization, such as scanning or photographing these documents into images or PDFs, does not solve the problem. The resulting files still take up a lot of storage space and require manual processing, which is error-prone and slow.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology takes you to the next step by automating the extraction of data from printed or written text into a machine-readable form that can be used to process, edit, or search for data.

Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET can help you get the best results with the least cost and effort. With just a few lines of code, you can create full-featured on-premise and web-based applications that convert images to text without having to worry about complicated technical details. We mean it - just [take a look](/ocr/python-net/hello-world/).
