## Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET

![Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET](aspose-ocr-python.png)

**Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET** adds optical character recognition (OCR) functionality to your cross-platform Python notebooks and applications. With it, you can extract text from scans, screenshots, pictures from the web, or even photos from your smartphone, returning results that can be aggregated, analyzed or saved to disk.

Like Python itself, our library runs on most popular operating systems: Microsoft Windows, Linux, Unix, and macOS. You can develop an application on one platform and run it on another without changing a single line of code.

Aspose.OCR supports 28 languages based on Latin, Cyrillic and Asian scripts, including Hindi and Chinese, and can recognize files in the most popular formats: PDF, JPG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, GIF or DjVu. Various processing filters allow you to recognize rotated, distorted and noisy images. The recognition results are returned in the most popular document and data exchange formats. Automatic spelling correction will further improve the accuracy without manual intervention.
