This reference will guide you through everything you need to know to get the most out of Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET.

Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET handles all aspects of recognition - from preprocessing the image to saving recognition results. A full-cycle OCR process involves 5 main stages:

![Stages of Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET image processing](ocr-stages.png)

1. **Preparing content for recognition**:

    - [Prepare a batch of images, scanned PDFs, URLs and other content for recognition](/ocr/python-net/ocrinput/)
    - [Apply image processing filters](/ocr/python-net/image-processing/)

2. **Configuring recognition parameters**:

    - [Specify a recognition language](/ocr/python-net/languages/)
    - [Limit the subset of characters the OCR module will look for](/ocr/python-net/characters/)
    - [Customize recognition parameters](/ocr/python-net/settings/)
    - [Select document areas detection algorithm](/ocr/python-net/areas-detection/)

3. **Recognizing**:

    - [Extract text](/ocr/python-net/recognition/)
    - [Recognize unified document types](/ocr/python-net/specialized-recognition-methods/)
    - [Balance recognition speed, quality, and resource usage](/ocr/python-net/performance-optimization/)

4. **Post-processing**:

    - [Detect and manipulate image regions](/ocr/python-net/image-regions/)
    - [Automatically correct misspelled words](/ocr/python-net/spelling/)

5. **Fetching recognition results**:

    - [Save recognition results as a file](/ocr/python-net/save-file/)
    - [Save recognition results as a searchable PDF](/ocr/python-net/save-searchable-pdf/)
    - [Get recognition results as text](/ocr/python-net/save-text/)
    - [Get recognition results as JSON](/ocr/python-net/save-json/)
    - [Get recognition results as XML](/ocr/python-net/save-xml/)
